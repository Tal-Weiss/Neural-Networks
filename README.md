# My Python Project

This project implements a simple machine learning framework with classes for calculating loss and optimizing weights. It includes methods for cross-entropy loss and gradient-based optimization.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Loss Calculation**: The `Loss` class in `loss.py` provides methods to compute the cross-entropy loss.
2. **Optimization**: The `Optimizer` class in `optimizer.py` includes methods for updating weights based on gradients.

### Example

In `main.py`, you can find an example of how to use the `Loss` and `Optimizer` classes with sample data.

## Requirements

- numpy
- matplotlib
